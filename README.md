# Basic-To-Do-webapp
 I developed a basic to-do list webpage that allows users to create a list of tasks that they need to complete.  The webpage typically includes a text field where the user can enter a new task, and a button that adds the task to the list. The list of tasks is displayed on the webpage,and a button that updates previous task and by clicking on the particular task  the user get cross out task and green color at background means the task is complete.
